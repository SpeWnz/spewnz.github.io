We often use the same programming patterns, so instead of repeating and re-writing the same things over and over, we've figured that we might aswell just wrap 'em all toghether in a nice bundle. ZHOR_Modules is the foundation of almost all the projects we work on. So if we publish something out, chances are you will be required to install this repo first.",
